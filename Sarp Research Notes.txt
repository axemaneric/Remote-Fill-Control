deadline: before the end of march
inputs:
	-commands open/close vent and fill valve
	-research about relays
-		-start storing data and end storing data
			-store it to different files no overwritten files (store time/timestamps)
		-pass a current on relay, opens a switch, electronic switch
		-one side of relay is RPI (control mechanism)
		-two GPIO for two valves
		-state of circuit
		-output state high/low
			-keep boolean
			-hookup output to input to keep track of output voltage
outputs
	-load cell scale readings
	-two pressure sensors
	-valve status
	-console read at the same time at waiting
	-localize the data, see it
	-store data research
	-how often to sample (sampling rate)
	-Steven's sampling rate vs storing sampling rate
	-HOW to store the data (binary bits)
